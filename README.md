# Golf-Olympics
I have a competition with two of my friends on the game "Golf With Your Friends" to decide who is the best. I used the stats from each game to see how people perfrormed. 

Using the matplotlib library and various processes, game stats were plotted to graphs and analyised manually for annotating.

Run the "golf.py" file to ise use the two text files and csv file and create a *pdf showing the analysis.
