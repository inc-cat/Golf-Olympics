There has been a long standing debate within my friendship group about who is the best at the game Golf With Your Friends. There have been many individual games in the past where games have been won by all parties involved but never a tournament to decide who is the best over a longer period.

Six 18 hole courses were played and the results were recorded hole by hole as a whole as opposed to being split into each course. Both cumulative scores and results against par are recorded and put into tables and plotted to graphs. From the results against par, averages will be included along side.
